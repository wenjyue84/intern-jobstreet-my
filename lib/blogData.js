# How to Write a Winning CV for Malaysian Internships

Landing an internship in Malaysia starts with a strong CV. Here's everything you need to know to create a CV that stands out.

## 1. Keep It Concise (1-2 Pages Maximum)

Malaysian employers prefer concise CVs. As a student, aim for 1 page. Include only relevant information:
- Personal details (Name, Phone, Email, LinkedIn)
- Education (Current university, CGPA if above 3.0)
- Relevant coursework or projects
- Skills (technical and soft skills)
- Experience (internships, part-time jobs, volunteer work)
- Co-curricular activities

## 2. Tailor Your CV to Each Application

Don't send the same CV everywhere! Customize it for each company:
- Read the job description carefully
- Highlight skills that match their requirements
- Use keywords from the job posting
- Show how your experience aligns with their needs

## 3. Highlight Your Technical Skills

For tech internships in companies like Grab or Shopee:
- List programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript)
- Frameworks and tools (React, Node.js, Git)
- Certifications or online courses completed
- GitHub profile or portfolio projects

## 4. Include Measurable Achievements

Instead of: "Helped with social media"
Write: "Increased social media engagement by 40% through content strategy"

Use numbers, percentages, and concrete results wherever possible.

## 5. Format Matters

- Use a clean, professional font (Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman)
- Consistent formatting throughout
- Bullet points for easy scanning
- Save as PDF to preserve formatting
- File name: YourName_CV_CompanyName.pdf

## 6. Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Including photo (not required in Malaysia unless specifically asked)
❌ Listing every subject you took in university
❌ Using fancy fonts or colors
❌ Grammatical errors or typos
❌ Unprofessional email addresses

## 7. Malaysian-Specific Tips

✅ Include your NRIC number only if requested
✅ Mention if you have driving license (for field-based internships)
✅ List languages spoken (English, Malay, Mandarin, Tamil)
✅ Include expected graduation date

# How to Ace Your Internship Interview in Malaysia

Congratulations on landing an interview! Here's your complete guide to interview success at Malaysian companies.

## Before the Interview (1 Week Prior)

### 1. Research the Company Thoroughly
- Visit their website and read About Us, Mission, Values
- Check recent news articles about the company
- Understand their products/services
- Read employee reviews on JobStreet or Glassdoor
- Follow their social media accounts

### 2. Understand the Role
- Re-read the job description
- Identify key skills required
- Prepare examples from your experience that demonstrate these skills
- Think about how you can add value to their team

### 3. Prepare Your Stories (STAR Method)
For behavioral questions, use the STAR format:
- **Situation**: Set the context
- **Task**: Describe the challenge
- **Action**: Explain what you did
- **Result**: Share the outcome

Example: "Tell me about a time you worked in a team"
- S: During my university's hackathon competition
- T: Our team had to build a mobile app in 24 hours with limited resources
- A: I organized daily standups, divided tasks based on strengths, and resolved conflicts
- R: We won 2nd place and our app was featured in the university newsletter

## Common Interview Questions in Malaysia

### Opening Questions
1. "Tell me about yourself" (Keep it to 2 minutes, focus on education, relevant experience, and why you're interested)
2. "Why do you want to intern here?" (Show genuine interest in the company)
3. "What do you know about our company?" (This is where research pays off!)

### Behavioral Questions
4. "Describe a challenge you faced and how you overcame it"
5. "Tell me about a time you showed leadership"
6. "How do you handle working under pressure or tight deadlines?"
7. "Describe a situation where you had to learn something new quickly"

### Technical Questions (For Tech Roles)
8. "Walk me through a project you're proud of"
9. "What programming languages are you comfortable with?"
10. "How would you approach [specific technical problem]?"

### Closing Questions
11. "What are your strengths and weaknesses?"
12. "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"
13. "Do you have any questions for us?" (ALWAYS ask questions!)

## Questions YOU Should Ask

Asking thoughtful questions shows you're serious about the role:

**About the Role:**
- "What does a typical day look like for an intern in this position?"
- "What kind of projects would I be working on?"
- "Will there be a mentor or supervisor assigned to me?"

**About the Team:**
- "How large is the team I'll be working with?"
- "What's the team culture like?"
- "How do you support interns' professional development?"

**About the Company:**
- "What are the company's goals for this year?"
- "What do you enjoy most about working here?"
- "Are there opportunities for full-time employment after the internship?"

## What to Wear (Malaysian Context)

### Formal Companies (Banks, Consulting, Corporate)
- **Men**: Long-sleeve shirt with tie, dress pants, leather shoes
- **Women**: Blouse with dress pants or knee-length skirt, closed-toe shoes

### Business Casual (Tech Startups, Creative Agencies)
- **Men**: Collared shirt (no tie), chinos, smart casual shoes
- **Women**: Smart blouse with pants or skirt, flats or low heels

**Pro tip**: When in doubt, dress slightly more formal. Better to be overdressed than underdressed!

## During the Interview

### Do's ✅
- Arrive 10-15 minutes early
- Bring extra copies of your CV
- Smile and make eye contact
- Speak clearly and confidently
- Use proper Malay/English (avoid slang)
- Take notes if offered
- Thank the interviewer at the end

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't badmouth previous employers or lecturers
- Don't check your phone
- Don't interrupt the interviewer
- Don't lie or exaggerate your skills
- Don't appear desperate or overly casual
- Don't forget to follow up with a thank-you email

## Virtual Interview Tips (Zoom/Google Meet)

Many Malaysian companies now do first-round interviews online:

1. **Test your technology** 30 minutes before
2. **Choose a quiet, well-lit location** with neutral background
3. **Dress professionally** from head to toe (yes, wear proper pants!)
4. **Look at the camera**, not the screen, when speaking
5. **Have your CV and notes** ready nearby
6. **Minimize distractions** (close other tabs, silence phone)

## After the Interview

### Send a Thank-You Email Within 24 Hours

Subject: Thank You - [Your Name] - [Position] Interview

\`\`\`
Dear [Interviewer's Name],

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me about the [Position] internship
at [Company Name] yesterday. I enjoyed learning more about the role and your

excited about [something specific from the interview].

Please feel free to contact me if you need any additional information.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone Number]
\`\`\`

## Follow-Up Timeline

- **1 week after interview**: If you haven't heard back, send a polite follow-up email
- **2 weeks**: Call or email HR to inquire about the decision timeline
- **3+ weeks**: Continue your job search; don't wait for one company

## Red Flags to Watch For

Be cautious if the company:
- Asks you to pay for training or equipment
- Offers unpaid internship without clear learning outcomes
- Seems disorganized or unprofessional
- Doesn't have a clear internship structure
- Promises unrealistic opportunities

## Final Tips for Malaysian Internship Interviews

🇲🇾 **Respect hierarchy**: Address interviewers with proper titles (Mr., Ms., Dr.)

🇲🇾 **Cultural awareness**: Be mindful of Malaysian workplace norms and values

🇲🇾 **Language**: Most interviews are in English, but be ready for Malay questions at government-linked companies

🇲🇾 **Transport**: Factor in KL traffic! Leave extra early for in-person interviews

## Practice Makes Perfect

Mock interviews help tremendously:
- Practice with friends or family
- Record yourself answering questions
- Join career workshops at your university
- Use InternMy's interview preparation resources

---

**You've got this!** 💪 Remember, every interview is a learning experience. Even if you don't get the internship, you're gaining valuable practice for the next opportunity.

## Should You Accept Unpaid Internships?

### ⚠️ Red Flags for Unpaid Internships
- No clear learning outcomes
- Doing menial tasks only
- No supervision or mentorship
- Long hours without benefits
- Company is profitable but doesn't pay

### When Unpaid Might Be Okay
- Non-profit organizations
- Short duration (< 1 month)
- Exceptional learning opportunity
- You have financial support
- Clear path to paid position

### Legal Considerations
While Malaysia has no specific law requiring intern payment, companies should provide:
- Reasonable allowance for living expenses
- SOCSO coverage (if applicable)
- Safe working environment

## How to Negotiate Your Allowance

### Do Your Research First
- Check Glassdoor, JobStreet salary data
- Ask seniors about their allowances
- Know the market rate for your role

### When to Negotiate
✅ After receiving the offer
✅ If you have competing offers
✅ If you bring unique skills
✅ For extended internship periods

❌ Don't negotiate during first interview
❌ Don't be aggressive or demanding

### Negotiation Script

"Thank you for the offer. I'm very excited about joining [Company]. Based on my research and the [specific skills/experience] I bring, I was hoping we could discuss the possibility of an allowance of RM[X]. Is there room for flexibility?"

### Alternative Negotiation Points
If allowance is fixed, ask for:
- Transport allowance
- Flexible working hours
- WFH options
- Extended internship with increment
- Training budget

## Tax Implications

Good news! In Malaysia:
- Internship allowances < RM34,000/year are **NOT taxable**
- Most internships fall below this threshold
- No need to file tax returns if only income is internship allowance

## Financial Planning Checklist

Before accepting an internship:
- [ ] Calculate total monthly expenses
- [ ] Research accommodation costs
- [ ] Understand transport options
- [ ] Check if company provides benefits
- [ ] Have 2-3 months emergency fund
- [ ] Discuss with parents/guardians if needed
- [ ] Consider student loans/scholarships timing
